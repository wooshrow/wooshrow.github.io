Some research from older days :)

* [T3](https://git.science.uu.nl/prase101/t3) is a random testing tool for Java. Would be fun to revive this project and put in new concepts... if we can magically create time :)

* [UNITY](https://webspace.science.uu.nl/~prase101/research/hol_downloads/about.html) related stuffs. UNITY is invented by Chandy and Misra back in 80s. It is an elegant formalism for modelling and reasoning about distributed systems. My work was on compositionality and mechanical verification of the needed theories in a higher order theorem prover. _'Compositionality'_ here means that you can combine/compose component programs and infer properties of the composite from the properties of the components without having to prove them from scratch. Not all properties are composable like that, so in my work I looked at which properties are composable, and under what condition. Should find some time to link this with the currently popular Separation Logic ...
